# CIS-5220-Project

This is the final project of CIS-5220- Deep Learning for Data Science. Our project is to Segment Tissues and Proliferating Cells in Light-Sheet Microscopy Images of Mouse Embryos Using Deep Learning.
Here, we implement U-net and Attention based U-net to segment three datasets available in ![here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7zkk4j415ncfs47/LSM_Segmentation_Dataset.zip?dl=0). 

How to run the files:

For PHH3 cell segmentation, there are two notebook files PHH3_cell_baseline_REAL(2) and PHH3_transfer_learning_REAL(2). The first notebook serves the implementation of the baseline U net model and the second one serves the implementation of the transfer learnt pretrained U-net model. 

For DAPI cell segmentation task, please run the notebook file named: 'model_train_and_test_DAPI_cells.ipynb'. 


For DAPI tissue segmentation task, please run the notebook file named: 'model_train_and_test_DAPI_tissue.ipynb'.
